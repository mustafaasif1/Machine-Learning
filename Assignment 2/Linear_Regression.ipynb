    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- The aim of this assignment is to give you a hands-on with a real-life machine learning application.\n",
    "- Use separate training, and testing data as discussed in class.\n",
    "- You can only use Python programming language and Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "- There are three parts of this assignment. In parts 1 & 2, you can only use **numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib and are not allowed to use NLTK, scikit-learn or any other machine learning toolkit**. However, you have to use **scikit-learn** in part 3.\n",
    "- Carefully read the submission instructions, plagiarism and late days policy below.\n",
    "- Deadline to submit this assignment is: **Friday, 30th October 2020**.\n",

    "## Submission Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit your code both as notebook file (.ipynb) and python script (.py) on LMS. The name of both files should be your roll number. If you don’t know how to save .ipynb as .py [see this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/L1rQH.png). **Failing to submit any one of them will result in the reduction of marks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plagiarism Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "The code MUST be done independently. Any plagiarism or cheating of work from others or the internet will be immediately referred to the DC. If you are confused about what constitutes plagiarism, it is YOUR responsibility to consult with the instructor or the TA in a timely manner. No “after the fact” negotiations will be possible. The only way to guarantee that you do not lose marks is “DO NOT LOOK AT ANYONE ELSE'S CODE NOR DISCUSS IT WITH THEM”.\n",
